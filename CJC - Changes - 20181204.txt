1. Property List - Change Title to Index cannot Login. I'm not sure this is the reason as it subsequently failed on other occasions and loaded after a retry
2. EWDashBoard 
		- Changed Submit buttons
		- Added <pre></pre> tags to line up Submit Buttons
		- Added @Html.ActionLink("Exit", "../Authorisation/EWDashBoard") to all options on Works Tab
		- Create(work) changed to Create new DEASP Elective works requests for approval and funding <pre><button type="button" onclick="location.href='@Url.Action("Create","Work")'">Submit</button></pre>
		- Reviewed Edit/Create/Delete actions to return to Works or List
		Added @Html.ActionLink("Exit", "../Home/Index") to Property List to redisplay Home Page
		
3.	Changed Funding Option which was giving error 
From.........			var Funding = db.Opwwork2.Include(w => w.Authorisation.Usersect == User_Section.Elective_Works && w.Status == Status.Pending_Approval);
To...........			var Funding = db.Opwwork2.Include(w => w.Authorisation).Where(w => w.Authorisation.Usersect == User_Section.Elective_Works && w.Status == Status.PendingFunding);
